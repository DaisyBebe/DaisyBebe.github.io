        <h1>About Me:</h1><br>
        
        <p> Hello hello &hearts;! My name is Sandra Chavez. I'm a nineteen year old living in Malaysia
            I have stayed here for about 9 years now, studying and travelling Asia. I love running, swimming,
             weightlifting, climbing, art, family, food, my lovely boyfriend, and animals.
              That is more than enough information than you will ever need about me based on the rather 
              useless prospects of this website, but I built it becuase I have recently picked up programming 
              and an interest in Computer Science. This website essentially embodies what I have learned so 
              far, so if it looks like shit, first of all I am a total noob, but secondly and rather most
               importantly, as I update the site, Me, and other users can monitor the progress that 
               I have made in programming, which I think, is pretty cool.
